# The rise of NFT is a prime example of the marriage between blockchain and art, attracting unprecedented public attention. In the foreseeable future, the NFT boom will continue to grow and transform the way how concepts and values are exchanged between blockchain and the real world. In 2020, the overall trading value of NFT tripled, reaching $250 million. In March 2021 alone, the total sales of NFT surpassed $220 million. It is predicted that in the next decade, 50% of the top 100 artists and artworks in the world will be registered as NFTâ€™s. 

The flaring NFT trading market is calling for the founding of Urbs, whose mission is to register world-class artworks as NFTs on-chain and build a bridge between top-notch artists and blockchain and support the growth of native crypto NFT artists, offering the chance for anyone to buy NFT's. This is the idea behind Urbs and it's native NFT Marketplace in which URBS token will be the primary payment method.
